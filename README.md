# SHS_scattering_control
Labview project for the control of the SHS experiment in the Saykally group

Complete project file for controlling the second harmonic scattering experiment in Dr. Rich Saykally's research group

The program controls the input polarization HWP and the rotating detection arm as well as counting the number of photons
at each angle step.

The program outputs two text files, one for the background counts measured in transmission geometry, 
and one contained background-subtracted counts at each measured angle step.
